Regression Summary

- Regression predicts some value y as a function of parameters θ and input features x:  
  y = f(θ, x)
- The goal is to learn the form of the function f from data.

Linear Regression:
- Assumes the form: y = θ_0 + θ_1 * x_1
- The task is to estimate θ_0 and θ_1 by reverse-engineering the function using data points.
- Predicted value: ŷ (y-hat)

Error Measurement:
- To measure accuracy, compare predicted and actual values. Two methods:
  - Mean Square Error (MSE): Average of squared differences: (y - ŷ)^2
  - Absolute Error: Average of absolute differences: |y - ŷ|

Closed Form Solution:
- Exact values for θ_0 and θ_1 can be computed mathematically but are often impractical for large datasets.
- Machine learning approximates good guesses instead.

Grid Search:
- A brute-force method that tests combinations of θ_0 and θ_1 over a specified range and increment to find the best fit.
