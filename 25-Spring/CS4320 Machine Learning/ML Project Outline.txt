ML Project Outline

* look at the big picture
* gather the data
* explore and visualize to get insight
    histograms, scatter plots, etc to find patterns
* prepare data for ML algorithms
    remove outliers (or look for potential errors related to outliers)
    what happens when we have gaps in our data (empty cells?)
        1. throw out those data points entirely?
        2. fill in missing data? (impute) how?
            we could go back to our histogram and just randomly pick a value and fill it in for that row
            we could also take the MEAN value rather than a random value (more representative of data as a whole)
            we could also use a MEDIAN value, sometimes a better representation
    split into training & testing data 80/20
    80% training data, 20% testing data is a common rule of thumb
* select a model and train it
    choose a linear regression model
* fine tune the model
    add/remove parameters
    data column scaling 
        scale data with x' = (x - mean) / stddev
* only at the VERY end, test against the testing data
* present your solution
* launch, monitor, and maintain your system
