ML Project Outline

* look at the big picture
* gather the data
* explore and visualize to get insight
* prepare data for ML algorithms
    remove outliers (or look for potential errors related to outliers)
    split into training & testing data 80/20
    80% training data, 20% testing data is a common rule of thumb
* select a model and train it
    choose a linear regression model
* fine tune the model
    add/remove parameters
    data column scaling 
        scaled data = (data - mean)/std dev
* present your solution
* launch, monitor, and maintain your system
