Sequential Data pt 2

vector: a collection of values
sequecne: a series of vectors

recurrent neuron: in addition to its input and output, also has a hidden internal loop simulating a history
Simple RNN: a series of recurrent neurons, each taking one value from a vector and each doing their own history

memory cell: we don't consider neurons or layers; just some structure that informs its future self of what its doing right now 

architectures:
sequence to sequence
sequence to vector
vector to sequence
encoder-decoder
