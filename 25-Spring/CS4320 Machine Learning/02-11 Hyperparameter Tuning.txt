Hyperparameter Tuning

       -->      numerical pipeline             \
      |         dataframe selector -> scaler    |
data -|                                          -->    model
      |         categorical pipeline            |
       -->      dataframe selector -> one-hot  /

in each step we do a fit and then a transform in sequence.
fit/transform -> fit/transform -> fit/transform -> fit/transform -> etc...
so whenever we do .fit() on a pipeline, ALL of that happens.

when a .predict() occurs, we simply transform new incoming data in every element in order WITHOUT fitting.
we don't change parameters, we just use them.

we can build a grid search function that makes a pipeline, collect a dictionary full of key value pairs (the value being a list of allowed parameters)
and let it cross validate ALL combinations of hyperparameters and remember the one with the best cross-validation score.
