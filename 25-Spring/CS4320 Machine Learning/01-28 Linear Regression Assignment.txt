Linear Regression Assignment
Use the Student Performance Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stealthtechnologies/predict-student-performance-dataset 
and the principles discussed in class to build a regression model that predicts student performance based on the available features.

Submit a detailed report including:
    Feature and Label Descriptions: Briefly explain the features and the target label in the dataset.
    Data Exploration:
        Include exploratory data analysis (EDA) plots such as histograms, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, etc.
        Highlight key trends and relationships in the data.
    Process:
        Describe the steps you followed to build and train your model.
        Discuss any challenges or decisions made during the process (e.g., handling missing data, scaling, etc.).
    Insights and Fine-Tuning:
        Mention any insights gained during EDA that influenced how you fine-tuned your model.
    Model Evaluation:
        Include Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for both the training data and the testing data.

Tips for Model Development
Library: 
    Use `scikit-learn` for its variety of regression algorithms and ease of use.
Focus on Regression:
    The goal is to predict floating-point numbers (e.g., student performance scores) from the features.
Default Algorithm:
    The sample algorithm discussed in class is the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Linear Regressor.
Explore Other Algorithms:
    Experiment with different regression algorithms in `scikit-learn` (e.g., `Ridge`, `Lasso`, `DecisionTreeRegressor`, etc.).
    Search for regression algorithms within the library, and try a few to determine which performs best.
    Scikit-learn's API is consistent, making it easy to plug and play different models.
Model Comparison:
    Evaluate the performance of each algorithm and choose the best fit based on metrics like MSE and MAE.

Next Steps
1. Understand the Dataset:
    Identify which features are most relevant for predicting the target variable.
2. EDA:
    Visualize the data to uncover patterns and potential preprocessing needs.
3. Preprocessing:
    Handle missing data, scale numerical features, and encode categorical data as needed.
4. Model Training:
    Begin with the SGD Linear Regressor, then experiment with other regression models.
5. Evaluation:
    Calculate and compare MSE and MAE for training and testing datasets.
6. Report Preparation:
    Document your process, findings, and conclusions clearly.
