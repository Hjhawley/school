linear regression assignment:
Use this Student Performance [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stealthtechnologies/predict-student-performance-dataset] dataset 
and the principles discussed in class to build a model that predicts student performance based on the available features.
Code submission will not be required for this assignment.
Also submit a report here of your findings. The report should include descriptions of the features and the label, data exploration plots, 
the process used, any insights found and used for fine-tuning, and the MSE and MAE loss for training data and testing data.

for a better fit, go to scikit learn
we are after REGRESSION - taking features and finding floating point numbers
the sample algorithm in the code is ths stochastic gradient descent linear regressor
there are many other kinds to be found on scikit learn
search for regression and try different kinds, and it's easy to plug and play
try different ones that might be better than SGD regressor! get comfortable with it
