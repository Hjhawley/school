Graphs 

Undirected graphs:
if a node a shares and edge with node b, node b also has an edge with node a 
Directed graphs:
edges may be one-way 

DEGREE of a vertex: number of edges that touch that vertex
a graph is CONNECTED if there exists a path between EVERY pair of vertices

Path: a sequence of distinct vertices such that each vertex is connected to the next with an edge 
Cycle: a path of length > 2 that begins and ends on the same vertex with no revisited nodes
Tree: a connected graph with no cycles

* Prove that for any undirected graph G:
the number of edges is equal to half the sum of the degree of each vertex. 
in other words: # of edges = 1/2 /sigma_vertex deg(v)
    Proof:
    each vertex in an undirected graph has n edges, and those n vertices has an edge back to it.
    /sigma_vertex deg(v) counts every edge of the graph EXACTLY twice; once from each end of the edge.

* Prove that there is an EVEN number of vertices with ODD degrees.
    Proof:
    This must be true if our last proof holds true.
    Suppose there were an odd number of vertices with odd degrees. 
    we would have an odd number of edges, which is impossible.
    # of edges = 1/2 /sigma_vertex deg(v) would result in a fractional number of edges.
    Another way to think of it: 2 * (# of edges) = /sigma_vertex deg(v), 
    so /sigma_vertex deg(v) MUST be even.

* Prove that if G has no cycles, it has a vertex with degree <= 1.
(this can include an unconnected graph.)
    Proof: a vertex of degree 2 or more has 2 neighbors.
    if this graph does NOT have a vertex with degree <= 1, then each of those 2 neighbors has at least 2 neighbors.
    so either we must recursively branch off into infinity, OR the 2 neighbors are neighbors to each other which creates a cycle.
    the only way to create a graph with no cycles (a tree) is for there to be "leaf" nodes with 1 or fewer edges.

* Prove that every tree with n vertices has n-1 edges.
    Proof by induction:
    Claim: Every tree with n vertices has n−1 edges.
    Base Case (n=1): A tree with 1 vertex has no edges, so the claim holds.
    Inductive Hypothesis: Assume every tree with n−1 vertices has n−2 edges.
    Inductive Step (IS): Let T be a tree with n vertices. Remove a vertex v and its neighboring edge, resulting in a graph T′.
        T′ has n−1 vertices. By the IH, T′ has (n−1)−1 = n−2 edges.
        Adding v and its edge back to T′ restores T, giving n−2+1=n−1 edges.
    Thus, by induction, every tree with n vertices has n−1 edges.
