Graphs

Undirected Graphs:
    If a node a shares an edge with node b, then node b also shares an edge with node a.
Directed Graphs:
    Edges may be one-way, meaning a connection from a to be does not imply b to a.

Degree of a Vertex: The number of edges connected to a vertex.
Connected Graph: A graph is connected if there exists a path between every pair of vertices.
Path: A sequence of distinct vertices where each vertex is connected to the next by an edge.
Cycle: A path of length > 2 that starts and ends at the same vertex, with no revisited nodes.
Tree: A connected graph with no cycles.

1. The Degree Sum Formula:
Claim: For any undirected graph G, the number of edges is half the sum of the degrees of all vertices.
    # of edges = 1/2 ∑(​vertex v) deg(v)
Proof:
Each edge contributes to the degree of exactly two vertices, 
so ∑(​vertex v) deg(v) counts every edge twice. 
Dividing by 2 gives the total number of edges.

2. Even Number of Odd-Degree Vertices:
Claim: An undirected graph always has an even number of vertices with odd degrees.
Proof:
- From the degree sum formula:
    2 * # of edges = ∑(​vertex v) deg(v)
    Since 2 * # of edges is always even, ∑(​vertex v) deg(v) must also be even.
- Vertices with odd degrees can only sum to an even number if there is an even count of them.

3. Graphs Without Cycles Have a Vertex with Degree ≤ 1:
Claim: A graph with no cycles (even if unconnected) has at least one vertex with degree ≤ 1.
Proof:
- If all vertices had degree ≥ 2, each vertex would have at least two neighbors.
- These neighbors would either connect back to form a cycle or create an infinite graph 
    (impossible with finite vertices).
- Thus, a graph with no cycles must have at least one "leaf" node with degree ≤ 1.

4. Trees Have n-1 Edges:
Claim: A tree with n vertices has exactly n-1 edges.
Proof (by induction):
1. Base Case (n=1):
    A tree with 1 vertex has no edges, so the claim holds.
2. Inductive Hypothesis (IH):
    Assume every tree with n-1 vertices has n-2 edges.
3. Inductive Step:
    Let T be a tree with n vertices.
    - Remove a vertex v and its connecting edge, resulting in a smaller tree T' with n-1 vertices.
    - By the IH, T' has n-2 edges. Adding back v and its edge gives n-1 edges.
Thus, by induction, every tree with n vertices has n-1 edges.
