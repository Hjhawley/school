Graphs 

Undirected graphs:
if a node a shares and edge with node b, node b also has an edge with node a 
Directed graphs:
edges may be one-way 

DEGREE of a vertex: number of edges that touch that vertex
a graph is CONNECTED if there exists a path between EVERY pair of vertices

Path: a sequence of distinct vertices such that each vertex is connected to the next with an edge 
Cycle: a path of length > 2 that begins and ends on the same vertex with no revisited nodes
Tree: a connected graph with no cycles

* Prove that for any undirected graph G:
the number of edges is equal to half the sum of the degree of each vertex. 
in other words: # of edges = 1/2 /sigma_vertex deg(v)
    Proof:
    each vertex in an undirected graph has n edges, and those n vertices has an edge back to it.
    /sigma_vertex deg(v) counts every edge of the graph EXACTLY twice; once from each end of the edge.

* Prove that there is an EVEN number of vertices with ODD degrees.
    Proof:
    This must be true if our last proof holds true.
    Suppose there were an odd number of vertices with odd degrees. 
    we would have an odd number of edges, which is impossible.
    # of edges = 1/2 /sigma_vertex deg(v) would result in a fractional number of edges.
