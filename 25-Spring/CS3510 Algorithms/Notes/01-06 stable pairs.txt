Introduction to Algorithms

Objectives:
- Develop a toolkit of ways to find efficient algorithms to solve problems
- Prove that algorithms are correct
- Analyze their efficiency properties
- Communicate these algorithms and their properties to others

Unstable Pairs:
A pair (x, .) and (., y) is unstable if:
- Applicant x prefers hospital y to their assigned hospital
- Hospital y prefers applicant x over one of its admitted residents

Stable Assignment:
- An assignment with no unstable pairs, meaning everyone is satisfied with their match
- This condition is both natural and desirable

Stable Matching Problem:
- Given two groups of n people, find a "suitable" partner for each
- Participants rank members of the opposite group from best to worst

Key Definitions:
- Perfect Matching: Everyone is matched to exactly one person from the other group
- Stability: Self-reinforcing condition where no incentive exists to undermine the assignment by joint action

Unstable Pair Definition:
For a matching M, a pair (p, r) from different groups is unstable if:
- p and r prefer each other over their assigned partners
- An unstable pair could improve by ignoring their assignment and pairing with each other

Stable Matching:
- A perfect matching with no unstable pairs

Problem Statement:
- Given a group of size n, create a stable matching for each pair

Quiz Questions:
1. Which defines a perfect matching?
   - B: Each person is matched to exactly one person from the other group
2. True/False: A pair (p, r) is considered unstable if p and r prefer each other over their current partners.
   - True
3. What is the stable matching problem and its goal?
   - B: Assign partners from two groups such that each person is matched and there are no unstable pairs

Stable Matching Examples:
- Problem 1: The matching is not stable because (X, B) is a preferable match for both parties.
- Problem 2: Even though Z prefers A and B over C, A and B prefer their current partners over Z, so no instability exists.

Do Stable Matchings Always Exist?
- No. The stable roommate problem provides a counterexample where every valid matching has some instability.
