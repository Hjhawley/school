Big-O comparison strategies
   Exponentials: 2^n and 3^n are different, which means 2^n and 2^n/2 are different!
   constant factors in exponents matter, unlike constant coefficients
   exponentials vs polynomials: every exponential grows faster than every polynomial
   log^a(n) is asymptotically less than n^b for any positive constants a,b 
   rewriting functions as 2^(f(n)) or log(f(n)) will often make it easier to find the correct order of functions.

log_a(b) = c
a^c = b

Functions in increasing order of Big O:

1. log(log(n)) <------ logarithmic functions
2/3. log(n)
2/3. log(n^2) (same as 2 * log(n) which is the same Big O!)
4. (log(n))^2 <------- polynomial functions
5. sqrt(n)
6. 2^log(n) <--------- exponential functions
7. 2^sqrt(n)
8. 3^sqrt(n)
9. 2^nlog(n) (why is this larger than 3^sqrt(n)?)
