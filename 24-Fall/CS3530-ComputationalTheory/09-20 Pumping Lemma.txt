Proving a Language is Not Regular (DFA, NFA, Regular Expressions)

1. Assume the language is regular (can be recognized by some DFA)
2. Let p be the pumping length (don’t need to know the specific number)
3. Pick a string w from the language such that |w| ≥ p
4. Split the string w into three parts: w = xyz, where:
   - |xy| ≤ p (the first part contains at most p symbols),
   - |y| ≥ 1 (the middle part is not empty),
   - y is the portion that can be pumped (repeated)
5. Check if pumping y can yield a string not in the language (contradiction)

Example: Prove that L = {a^n b^n | n ≥ 0} is not regular

- Choose the string w = a^p b^p \in L, where |w| = 2p ≥ p.
- Split w into x, y, z such that w = xyz, where:
  - |xy| ≤ p, so both x and y consist of only a's.
  - Let y = a^k, where k ≥ 1.
- Pump y: Consider the string w' = x y^2 z = a^{p+k} b^p.
- The string w' has more a's than b's, which means w' ∉ L.
- This contradicts the assumption that L is regular.
- Therefore, L = {a^n b^n | n ≥ 0} is not regular.

Proving a Language is Not Context-Free (CFG, PDA)

To prove that a language is not context-free, we use the Pumping Lemma for Context-Free Languages:

1. Assume the language is context-free. This means that it can be generated by some context-free grammar or recognized by a PDA (pushdown automaton).
2. Let p be the pumping length, which is the constant given by the Pumping Lemma for context-free languages.
3. Pick a string w from the language such that |w| ≥ p.
4. Split the string w into five parts: w = uvxyz, where:
   - |vxy| ≤ p,
   - v and y are not both empty (|vy| ≥ 1).
5. Pump v and y: Check whether repeating or removing v and y yields a string not in the language. If it does, then the language is not context-free.
6. Find a contradiction: If pumping v and y produces a string that is not in the language, we have found a contradiction.

Example: Prove that L = {a^n b^n c^n | n ≥ 0} is not context-free

- Assume L is context-free.
- Let p be the pumping length.
- Choose the string w = a^p b^p c^p \in L, where |w| = 3p ≥ p.
- Split w = uvxyz, where |vxy| ≤ p.
  - Since |vxy| ≤ p, the portion vxy is confined to the first p symbols, which are all a's and possibly some b's.
  - Thus, vxy contains no c's.
- Pump v and y: Consider the string uv^2 xy^2 z, which will have more a's than b's and c's.
- The new string uv^2 xy^2 z will have an unequal number of a's, b's, and c's, meaning it is not in L.
- This contradicts the assumption that L is context-free.
- Therefore, L = {a^n b^n c^n | n ≥ 0} is not context-free.
